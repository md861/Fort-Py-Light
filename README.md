# FortPy theme light
Custom built theme for Fortran and Python markups in VS Code. The theme is based on the Brackets light pro theme tweaked to my own preferences.

## Installation
* Download the latest version *vsix* file. 
* Open the download folder in VS Code.
* In VS Code, open a terminal and type `code --install-extension <.vsix-filename>` where use the name of the *vsix* file downloaded.
* The theme should be accessible in the Color theme collections (Ctrl+k+t). You may have to restart VS Code (to refresh the theme list) to see the FortPy theme in the collections.
